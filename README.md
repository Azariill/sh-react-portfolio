## Usage
 This is my personal portfolio site. It is for personal use only.
 This was a class project to fullfill this user story: 
   #### GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
   #### WHEN I load the portfolio
   #### THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
   #### WHEN I view the header
   #### THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
   #### WHEN I view the navigation titles
   #### THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
   #### WHEN I click on a navigation title
   #### THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
   #### WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
   #### THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
   #### WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
   #### THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
   #### WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
   ####THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository
   #### WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
   #### THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
   #### WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
   ####THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
   #### WHEN I enter text into the email address field
   #### THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
   #### WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
   #### THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
   #### WHEN I view the footer
   #### THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
